social media search that can deliver search results based on a combination of location, username and 'hashtags'

example query: 'houston #dogs' would return all the cute dog related posts in the local Houston TX area. this would yield better results than relying on '#houstondogs' being used on all Houston dog posts, so many good dogs are overlooked this way! 

uses 'MERN Stack',
Node JS backend (Mongo DB, Express Js)
JS frontend (React)

This is a type of search I personally wish was standard on all social media type websites because it makes it easier for a user to find specific content that they are interested in! :)
