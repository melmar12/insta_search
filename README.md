[demo](https://shrouded-hollows-29446.herokuapp.com/)

JUST deployed a demo. The UI will be refined soon! :) its ugly for now, sorry!

#### how to use:
1. type a location, username or hashtag in input field (find something matching current data to return something)
2. choose as either username, location or hashtag
3. hit 'search' button to return result 

social media search that can deliver search results based on a combination of location, username and 'hashtags'

example query: 'houston #dogs' would return all the cute dog related posts in the local Houston TX area. this would yield better results than relying on '#houstondogs' being used on all Houston dog posts, so many good dogs are overlooked this way! 

uses 'MERN Stack',
Node JS backend (Mongo DB, Express Js)
JS frontend (React)

This is a type of search I personally wish was standard on all social media type websites because it makes it easier for a user to find specific content that they are interested in! :)
