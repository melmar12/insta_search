The UI will be refined to be more intuitive soon! :) its ugly for now, sorry!

#### how to use:
1. type a location, username or hashtag in input field (find something matching current data to return something)
2. choose as either username, location or hashtag
3. hit 'search' button to return result when ready

#### about:

social media search that can deliver search results based on a combination of location, username and 'hashtags'

example query: 'houston #dogs' would return all the cute dog related posts in the local Houston TX area. this would yield better results than relying on '#houstondogs' being used on all #dog posts with location Houston, so many posts are overlooked this way! This is a type of search that would deliver more results based on what a user is interested in finding.
